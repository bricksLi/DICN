# DICN
An implement of a paper: "A Deep graph clustering model integrating community structure with neighborhood information of nodes"
run dicn.py

# Notice
1. main environment: Pytorch 1.11.0, torch_geometric 2.0.4
2. We have prepared the pre-training vector corresponding to the Cora dataset. If the pre-training vector of other datasets is needed, it can be generated by referring to the paper and modifing the SuperGAT file to get it by yourself.

Our model mainly refers to [How to Find Your Friendly Neighborhood: Graph Attention Design with Self-Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04879) and [vGraph: A Generative Model for Joint CommunityDetection and Node Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07159)
